<p class="p1"><b>Foreward</b></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The creation of this project presents a number of interesting challenges. Principally, I’m attempting to respond to something I’ve never seen: Christian Marclay’s “The Clock.” Thus, my material for response is limited to a short clip of the film posted to YouTube and the reactions of other critics and academics. However, this constraint in some sense liberates me. Without my own specific reactions to the whole piece—without having been drawn into Marclay’s crafted experience—I am freer to analyze the role of the piece as a&nbsp;<a href="social-object-1" rel="urn:scalar:version:24487">social object</a>: simultaneously a product of our times and an explanation of them. “The Clock” could not exist without the clockwork of film which makes it up, but its beauty draws even more compellingly from the reactions it invokes from critics and the particular atmosphere with which it is crafted. Thus, this is a piece less about “The Clock” as an artwork as an art phenomenon.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Of course, like with any phenomenon, writing about “The Clock” can pose certain challenges. In particular, this phenomenon is one which utilizes three essential dimensions which are challenging to capture in writing: sound, time, and atmosphere. As other critics have conceived, a mere essay is not the ideal form of response to Marclay’s seminal work. (NYB7) However, I shall endeavor to embrace a challenge similar to, in form if not in scope, that of Marclay’s. While he was a filmmaker acting like a writer, I shall play the part of the chronographer. Consider this piece to be a written chronograph, a reflection on time in “The Clock” and the times it represents.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Like any good watch, this chronograph embraces the inherent&nbsp;<a href="imaginary-2" rel="urn:scalar:version:20425">illusion</a>&nbsp;of time, and its implicit distortion ability. It can be read at any level of granularity. If you merely need a quick summary of this piece, just glance at the themes articulated in the middle of our written chronograph: <i>time, film, plot, and story</i>. Should this be insufficient for your purposes, the subtler passages of argument are split into twelve portions. Finally, every passage is split into 60 <i>minutes</i>, each of which constitutes a complete entity, whether a citation, sentence, or image. Together, these 720 minutes, split into twelve arguments and four themes, form the whole arc of this argumentative chronograph. However, the chronograph itself is my thesis: “The Clock” is a monument to and defense of time.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>0: Time</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>In the beginning, there was no time. Or, rather, there was <i>always</i> time. We, humanity, were constrained by the temporality of the present. Actions could only be done sequentially and they took, essentially, as long as they took. Environmental factors dictated our life, from sundown to sunup. Modern means of mechanization had not yet begun to annihilate time. (Solnit) We existed as fish swimming through time, with no more need to define and demarcate it than a fish has to define water. Time was both everywhere.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>1: Industrial Revolution</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Though the assault of&nbsp;<a href="deus-ex-machina-2" rel="urn:scalar:version:20304">mechanism</a>&nbsp;on time had begin decades earlier, with Greek philosophers attacking its veritable basis (<i>On Truth</i>), the industrial revolution struck a fearsome blow against old Kronos. With the incorporation of modern machinery, we began to annihilate space and time. (Solnit) Time was no longer an intractable component of existence. The telegraph could transport ideas and messages instantaneously, with trains reaching nearly that speed (in relative terms). Production schedules for whole ranges of goods switched from years to hours. Even more importantly, time was no longer an inherent component of a particular entity. While a road might have previously had a distance fixed in time (“3 days on horse”), that time-distance could be consistently shrunken with incremental improvement. We were no longer slaves to Father Time: machines enabled us to fight back.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Yet, instead of aggressively joining machines in that war, we embraced our former master, firmly enshrining time in our lives. Modern machinery had rapidly compressed the amount of time which it takes for production: the knitting of wool which would have taken days could be done in hours. However, we “shackle[d] ourselves to a schedule” even more fiercely. (NYT1.7) Clocks became ubiquitous in the workplace, with the Western world converging on a common clock. Work was no longer measured by its completion but by the duration of time. Indeed, the end of the workday is one of the most prolific hours of Marclay’s “The Clock” with hundreds of movies depicting that crucial 5pm hour when <i>the clock </i>(not our bodies our our nature) telling us that work is complete. The modern workplace, as Marclay captures, is driven by the precision of time—despite our relative abundance of it.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Nowhere is this clearer than with trains. They represented one of the most aggressive attacks on the tyranny of time: destinations which were previously unreachable in a day became a matter of hours, with modern trains compressing those hours into minutes. Yet, despite this newfound abundance of time, trains treat time as incredibly scarce. As shown by dozens of clips from Marclay’s film, people are constantly rushing to catch trains which left precisely at the hour. When a train arrives even a moment late, we glance anxiously at our watch. Trains are ruled by a harsh and unforgiving timetable which has put <i>time</i> at the center of the train experience: the prototypical conductor is always looking at his pocketwatch. When the machinery of locomotives assaulted time by compressing distances we chose to elevate time by running our trains strictly by it and constructing ornate alters to it throughout stations. Indeed, Marclay originally hoped to have “The Clock” displayed in the ultimate temple to time: a train station. (NY1.15)</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>2: Enterprise</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marclay’s production of “The Clock” is thus firmly rooted in the modern relationship with time, which began with the Industrial Revolution. Indeed, its the chronological scale of the piece itself which often most impresses viewers. They ponder how long it must have taken Marclay to construct this piece, with Google not having digitized every cinematographic clock. (NYB6) Of course, the production techniques themselves were a testament to time and our modern monument to it. In true industrial style, with a budget to match, Marclay hired a number of assistants to parse through dozens of films in search of clocks. (NY1.7) He engaged in the fundamental transaction of modern times: paying assistants for their time. In return, on a predetermined schedule, they dropped off clips of clocks culled from the history of film. Thus, “The Clock” is not merely the work of a singular genius but the result of a modern chronological enterprise wherein labor’s time is converted into art (and, implicitly, money).</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>3: Film</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though Marclay’s methods might flirt with time, his medium penetrates to its very core. Film, the moving image, is inherently the application of time to a picture: the sequential viewing of a series of photographs. (Citations? Solnit?) Without time, film has no meaning. Indeed, many Hollywood films embrace this fact with plots entirely centered around time, from <i>24</i> to <i>Groundhog Day</i>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Film is not merely dependent on time to exist artistically but also socially. Film provides clear demarcations of history, providing a shared sense of time across a society where the individual events of life don’t match. 1940 might have been when you got divorced and I got married, but its also when <i>Gone with the wind</i> came out for all of us. Thus, film exists as shared measurement of time. Indeed, much of the joy from “The Clock” comes from the occasional recognition of a particular clip (and the associated knowledge of its place in historical time). Through the compilation of film, “The Clock” is a monument to the role which cinematographic time has filled in the modernity of America.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>4. Deception</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“The Clock” is also a deconstruction of the role of time in film. While American cinema is replete with chronologically-centered films, they all exist on different time scales. Orson Welles’s midnight is not that of James Bonds. (NYB3) Each film constructs its own timescale, a timescale inherent to its functioning as a film—a timespace where its quicker to make dinner than to fire a gun. By juxtaposing these films, Marclay destroys the illusion of their different time scales. He transforms fictional time into documentary time, taking the unreal ticking of a bomb into the real ticking of time. (NY 2.2) Yet, in doing so he might also remind us that our “real” time is also constructed: by grafting other times into ours, he makes us wonder whether our time is any more real. This is done most potently, perhaps, with a clip from <i>Easy Rider</i>, where Peter Fonda’s glance at a stopped watch serves to demarcate the real time of 11:40am. (Guardian) But if a broken fictional watch can accurately tell the real time, then what makes our time any more accurate?&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1">5.&nbsp;<b>Immortality</b></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marclay also manipulates the role of film as a societal timepiece. While clips provide the tantalizing prospect of remembering the past, acting provides the even more appealing prospect of transcending time. With their moving image caught in the mechanism of film, actors could possibly exist forever. Man, aided and abetted by machine, would have defeated time. “The Clock” almost celebrates this victory, but then seizes defeat from its jaws. While we might recognize some clips and certain actors, even more flow by without being recognized. Actors who once thought themselves timeless and immortal have been rendered mortal by the mortality of their audiences. Thus, the entropy of the universe is revealed: film can slow down time, but not defeat it. Indeed, Marclay’s exhibition choices play into this by demanding that the viewing of “The Clock” be a shared experience, conducted on couches in a public space. There, the absurdity of immortality is completely demonstrated: while I might recognize certain figures, the presence of other (younger) patrons reveals that the actors mortality rests in my own. By juxtaposing famous and unknown films in front of diverse audiences, Marclay creates a defense of time against the onslaught of mechanized archivalism.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>6. Plot</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">While certainly aware of the tricks which films play to create plot, Marclay himself deploys those tricks to create a plot for his film: a plot for time itself. By pulling in different clips from the same film, Marclay compresses that film’s plot into his own—in the process, escalating its tension, much like a series of trailers. Indeed, he builds a plot around the rising tensions associated with much of American film. As each hour approaches, a sense of impending climax approaches—yet never comes. Thus, “The Clock” creates a plot of comedy, not tragedy. (NYB) With each moment approaching the hour, our expectations are built up more and more—only to be shattered. As the film approaches midnight, suspense multiplies with howls and explosions wracking the night. Yet, right after the bell tolls and Big Ben is destroyed, we see the shining timepiece restored. Thus, the comedic message: the plot, and our expectations, are driven solely by the documentarian nature of time. As much as we might fear and combat time, it remains intact in the plot of “The Clock.”</span></p><p class="p1">7.&nbsp;<b>Sound</b></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The key to building this plot is sound. While the visual clips are rigidly separated, driven by the harsh dictates of time, Marclay allows sound to bleed to clip to clip. The common rhythm of sound—particularly the tempo of music—pulls together disparate clips. Thus, Marclay does with sound what other directors do with full audiovisual stimulation: create a plot through time. As the tempo rises near the end of the hour, our expectations rise as well. Yet, this is also a mockery of the existing auditory processes. By crafting a seemingly consistent theme from disparate images, Marclay shows how Hollywood directors use music to manipulate audiences to buy into their time narrative. Indeed, Marclay even changes the meaning of particular clips—from mundane to dramatic, or vice versa—through the sounds which he overlays on top. (NY2.3) Thus, Marclay reveals the common tropes of Hollywood scores. This is particularly evident with the minutes preceding midnight. Marclay doesn’t need to doctor these clips at all: they all naturally include the same screeching violins, a visceral reminder of the limited vocabulary which Hollywood has to metonymically craft a timescale and associated emotions. (NYB5) Simply through violins and consistent plots, human conceptions of time and the role of midnight have been artificially constructed—a construction which Marclay simultaneously reveals and revels in.</span></p><p class="p1">8.&nbsp;<b>Environment</b></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Of course, this soundscape is only powerful because it plays to our cultural conceptions of time and associated tropes. Thus, Marclay requires a specific environment to sustain the plot. Rather than releasing the video publicly, with virtually anyone able to watch it, Marclay constrains it to public and shared spaces in major cities. This transforms the work from a mere art piece into a cultural artifact. Each installation invites people to come experience it together, sharing in the illusion of its plot and playing off each other's emotions as the essential hours approach. Watching the lead-up to midnight in front of a laptop at home might be dramatic, but the tension wouldn’t have the same palpability as that in a shared public venue.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Furthermore, the shared space allows Marclay to have (nearly) complete control over the exact environment of his production, an aspect essential to him. (NY1.15) He can ensure that his elaborate soundscape isn’t drowned out by other noises and that the lighting provides a perfect canvas for construction of a visual chronograph. Indeed, Marclay even maintains precise control over the chronological elements. The entire film is encapsulated in a computer program which ensures clips are played in perfect synchronoization with local time and that any lapses are corrected immediately. (NY1.12). Thus, Marclay’s “The Clock” is a beautiful Swiss watch: beneath the beautiful varnish of art and plot lies technical mastery which truly reveals the point of the production. Through environmental and atmosphere perfectionism, Marclay emphasizes the creation of the perfect chronograph.</span></p><p class="p1">9.&nbsp;<b>Story</b></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Indeed, that is the ultimate story of Marclay’s work: that measurement of time is something worth caring about. Perhaps informed by his Swiss roots, Marclay places a premier emphasis on time throughout the work, both in its technical accuracy and its philosophical import. Essential to this is a decision about who <i>owns</i> the time. While Marclay certainly retains a tight grip on the clock itself, the work clearly reveals shared societal ownership of time and our fleeting individual ability to grasp it. Through artistic mastery, he is able to draw in viewers for hours more than they had expected. Yet, perhaps sadistically, we spend those hours by literally watching them fly by. Marclay need not resort to trickery and deception in capturing those hours. The time his film conveys is real, as is the time it takes up, yet we willingly cue up for the priviledge of viewing it.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Indeed, this queuing itself is essential to the narrative of “The Clock.” Rather than&nbsp; allowing for simultaneous viewing online, Marclay requires that the project be rooted firmly in place. Indeed, no two installations ever project the film simultaneously, thus further undermining the concept of synchronicity. While the technology exists today to make simultaneous projection easily, Marclay roots time in space, thus providing a defense for it. After all, if the film could simultaneously show 2am in Tokyo and 12pm in New York, then the shared illusion of objective time is undermined.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>10. Father Time</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">While it is thus clear that time is the focus of the work, the message about time itself is somewhat more muddled. After all, what exactly is the message of a clock? Only this: time is ticking. Yet, that itself is a powerful message. That time is ticking is a reminder of the mortal condition, of our inability to completely overcome it despite modern devices. Time, ultimately is the presage to death, and that’s a reminder that Marclay willingly conveys. Our machines are losing the battle to overcome time, as are we. We might have built the clocks, but we don’t control them. Like Orson Welles, we’re about to die: we’re “on the minute hand of a clock” which we created.</span></p><p class="p1">11.&nbsp;<b>Altar</b></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Thus, “The Clock” is yet another acknowledgement that machines have lost the war against time. Indeed, it is an altar to that victory and a testament to time’s defensibility. The Internet might allow us to communicate intercontinentally instantaneously, yet every packet is still timestamped. Trains annihilate the time between places, yet the conductor continuously glances at his pocket watch. Technology makes our labor far more efficient, yet the clock still hangs over the office. Institutions which connect the world, from stock exchanges to global universities, hang world clocks as reminders of the times which divide us.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>In a time when time is under attack, we build monuments and defenses of it. Big Ben still tours over London, even when the entirety of the Commonwealth can be reached within a day via jet. The second tallest building in the world, in Mecca, is a clocktower—in a time when prayer calls are distributed digitally via a smartphone app. And in the age of short YouTube mashups, Christian Marclay created a 24-hour masterpiece: an altar to time and a citadel to defend against its annihilation.</span></p></div>
